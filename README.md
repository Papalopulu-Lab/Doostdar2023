### This repository contains three separate resources:
1) Mathematical model code is for multicellular Her6 dynamics which explores the effects of altered degradation rates on Notch-Delta patterning
2) Neighbour analysis code quantifies differences in Her6 intensity between neighbouring cells
3) Detection of oscillators using Gaussian process approach
